# Music-website 
In this website, I have build a music player using HTML CSS and js. This music player will have all the features found in a typical music player. 
You will be able to add, play, pause and seek songs that have been added.
To run this app simply click the below link,
"https://music-website-q9he.onrender.com/"
Its the deployment link which is deployed online through render website.
As this website is free to use, you can experience a slight delay and some of the images would not be seen, by simply reloading the website it would solve the issue.
Enjoy the music. 
Thank you.
